# Hertzoggie

Hertzoggie is a collection of cookiecutter templates, particularly for Python projects.

## Usage

First, install cookiecutter:

```bash
pip install cookiecutter
```

Then, use cookiecutter to generate a new project using a Hertzoggie template:

```bash
cookiecutter https://github.com/dennis-barrett/hertzoggie.git --directory="template-name"
```

Here `template-name` is one of the template types described in the next section.
